# Test Journal Entries

## Single Skill Triggers

### Tech Job Search
I'm really frustrated with my current job. The work environment is toxic and I'm not learning anything new. I think it's time to look for new software engineering positions, maybe in full-stack development or machine learning.

### HackerNews
I want to catch up on what's trending in tech today. I always find interesting discussions on HackerNews and I'd love to see what the top posts are right now.

### Weather
I'm planning a hiking trip to Yosemite this weekend and I'm wondering what the weather will be like. Should I pack a rain jacket? I need to check the forecast for the next few days.

### X.com Post
Just had a hot take: the future of AI isn't about replacing developers, it's about making us 10x more productive. I should post this on Twitter.

### Google Calendar
I need to schedule a dentist appointment for next Tuesday at 2pm. It's at the downtown office on Main Street. Should block out about 90 minutes for the whole thing.

### YouTube Search
I want to learn how to build a RAG application with LangChain. I should find some good YouTube tutorials on this topic.

### Amazon Add to Cart
My mechanical keyboard is getting worn out. I've been eyeing the Keychron K2 wireless mechanical keyboard. I should add it to my Amazon cart.

### Gmail Draft
I need to send an email to my manager about the project timeline. Send to sarah@company.com with subject 'Q1 Project Timeline Update'. Body: Hi Sarah, I wanted to give you an update on the Q1 project timeline. We're making good progress but we may need an extra week to complete the testing phase.

## Non-Triggering Entries

### Neutral 1
Today was a quiet day. I spent most of the morning reading a book about philosophy and thinking about the nature of consciousness. I made some coffee around noon and sat on my porch watching the birds.

### Neutral 2
I'm feeling grateful today for the small things. My morning cup of tea was perfect, the sun was shining through my window, and I had a nice conversation with an old friend.

### Neutral 3
Random thoughts from today: Why do we park in driveways and drive on parkways? I noticed my neighbor got a new plant. The grocery store was surprisingly empty this afternoon.

### Neutral 4
I've been getting back into painting lately. Today I worked on a landscape piece - nothing too ambitious, just trying to capture the colors of sunset.

## Multi-Skill Triggers

### Job Search + Weather
I'm so done with my current job. The company culture is terrible and I need to look for new opportunities in machine learning roles. Also, I'm planning to go camping in Colorado next weekend and I really need to check what the weather will be like in Denver.

### Calendar + Email
I need to schedule a team meeting for next Thursday at 3pm to discuss the product roadmap. Also, I should draft an email to team@company.com about this meeting.

### YouTube + Amazon
I want to learn how to build a home server and set up my own NAS system. I should find tutorial videos on YouTube. Also, I need to add a WD Red 4TB hard drive to my Amazon cart - make that 3 drives for the RAID setup.

### Triple: HackerNews + X Post + Weather
I want to catch up on what's trending on HackerNews today. Also, I just realized: AI actually amplifies human creativity - this is a hot take I should tweet. Oh, and I'm going to the beach Saturday, need to check the weather for Santa Monica.

### All Data Retrieval: Job + HackerNews + Weather + YouTube
I'm unhappy with my current job - need to look for DevOps opportunities. Also want to see what's trending on HackerNews. For my Seattle trip next week, I should check the weather. Finally, I want to learn Rust - should find YouTube tutorials.
